<h3>THE PERSUIT OF HAPPINESS</h3>
<P>Life is a struggle for single father Chris Gardner (Will Smith). Evicted from their apartment, he and his young son (Jaden Christopher Syre Smith) find themselves alone with no place to go. Even though Chris eventually lands a job as an intern at a prestigious brokerage firm, the position pays no money. The pair must live in shelters and endure many hardships, but Chris refuses to give in to despair as he struggles to create a better life for himself and his son.

<h3>INTO THE WILD</h3>
<P>Into the Wild, by Jon Krakauer, is the nonfiction (true) story of Chris McCandless, a young man who drops out of society to wander across the country and eventually dies on a hiking trip in Alaska. </P>
<h3>THE DICTATOR</h3>
<p>Gen. Aladeen (Sacha Baron Cohen) has ruled the oil-rich North African country of Wadiya since the age of six, when 97 stray bullets and a hand grenade killed his father in a hunting accident. After an assassination attempt takes the life of yet another body-double, Tamir (Ben Kingsley), Aladeen's uncle and most trusted adviser, convinces Aladeen to go to New York. Unfortunately, Aladeen has a less-than-friendly reception from exiled Wadiyans, who want their country freed from his despotic rule.</p>
